# Tech Stack

# Running the Project

- `npm run build` to build the project.
- `npm run dev` to start the development server.
- `npm run lint` to run the linter.
- The easiest way to check if what you did is correct is to run lint since build takes a long time.
- If you decide to build the project, you do not have to run lint first since it will run automatically as part of the build process.
